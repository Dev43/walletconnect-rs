# WalletConnect Rust Client

:warning: **This crate is currently still a work in progress** :warning:

A WalletConnect client implementation in Rust. Currently only a small subset of
the full API is implemented. In particular:
- Creating a session and performing a handshake with a wallet
- Displaying a QR code to a UTF-8 compatible terminal
- Sending a transaction
